##This is notes for myself during development

**Systems that have to rely on continuous updates & timestamp provided by game loop:
  1. Player systems (movement, camera control, input polling)
  2. Physics (collision detection, gravity & forces, projectile movement)
  3. Animation (Character & object animation, ui animations)
  4. AI (pathfinding, state evaluations)
  5. Environmental Systems (weather effects & particles, this is more animation heavy but still need some updated calculation; day-night cycles and light, environmental movement like clouds, water waves and other ambient effects)
  6. Timers and Counters (Cooldowns, event timers)
  7. Combat (Projectile behavior, despawning, DOT)
  8. Sound (likely ignore those at this stage... but some ambient sounds need smooth transitioning effects too)

**System that have to rely on event triggers
  1. Input handling
  2. UI Systems
  3. Dialogue & Story Progression
  4. Inventory & Items
  5. Combat (attack commands, enemy spawning when enter an area)
  6. Environmental Triggers like events and interactions
  7. Quest system
